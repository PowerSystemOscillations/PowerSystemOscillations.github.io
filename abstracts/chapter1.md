# Chapter 1: Introduction
## Abstract
Electric power systems are among the largest structural achievements
of man. Some transcend international boundaries, but others supply the
local needs of a ship or an airplane. The generators within an
interconnected power system usually produce alternating current, and
are synchronized to operate at the same frequency. In a synchronized
system, the power is naturally shared between generators in the ratio
of the rating of the generators, but this can be modified by the
operator. Systems, which operate at different frequencies, can also be
interconnected, either through a frequency converter or through a
direct current tie. A direct current tie is also used between systems
that, while operating at the same nominal frequency, have difficulty
in remaining in synchronism if interconnected.
