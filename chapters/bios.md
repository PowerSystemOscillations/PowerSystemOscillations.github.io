**Graham J. Rogers**, graduated in Electrical Engineering, with first
class honors from Southampton University, Southampton, U.K., in 1961.
From 1961 to 1964, he was a Consultant Mathematician with
A.E.I. (Rugby) Ltd., U.K. From 1964 until 1978, he was a Lecturer in
electrical engineering at Southampton University. He immigrated to
Canada in 1978 to work for Ontario Hydro, Toronto, ON, in the Power
System Planning Division. After his retirement in 1993, he operated
Cherry Tree Scientific Software, Colborne, ON. He was Associate
Professor (part time) at McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, from 1982
to 1996, Visiting Professor at I.I.T. Madrid in 1997, and later
Adjunct Associate Professor at the University of Toronto. He was a
Fellow of the IEEE, an active member of several IEEE Power
Engineering Society Working Groups, and served as an Associate Editor
of *IEEE Transactions on Control System Technology* from 1994
to 1997. Graham authored the first edition of *Power System
Oscillations*, published in 2000.

**Ryan T. Elliott**, **Ph.D.**, received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees
in electrical engineering from the University of Washington, Seattle,
in 2012 and 2020, respectively. From 2012 to 2015, he was a Research
Scientist with the Electric Power Systems Research Department at
Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, NM. In 2015, he returned
to the University of Washington to pursue a Ph.D., working as a
Research Assistant in the Renewable Energy Analysis Laboratory from
2015 to 2020. In 2020, he rejoined Sandia where he is currently a
Principal Member of Technical Staff. Dr. Elliott led the development
of the WECC model validation guideline for central station
photovoltaic power plants in 2015. He also received an R&D 100 Award
for his contributions to a real-time damping control system using PMU
feedback in 2017.

**Daniel J. Trudnowksi**, **Ph.D.**, received the M.S. and
Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Montana State
University, Bozeman, in 1988 and 1991, respectively. From 1991
through 1995, he was with Battelle at the Pacific Northwest National
Laboratory where he was a Research Engineer. In 1995, he joined
Montana Technological University in Butte, where he is currently a
Professor of Electrical Engineering. Over the past 30 years, his
research activities have primarily focused on problems related to
power system dynamics and controls. Dr. Trudnowski is a Fellow of the
IEEE and is a registered professional engineer in the state of
Montana.

**Felipe Wilches-Bernal**, **Ph.D.**, received an M.S. degree in
control systems and signal processing from Universit√© Paris-Sud XI,
Orsay, France, and a Ph.D. in electrical engineering from the
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. He currently works as a Software
Engineer at Google in Boulder, CO. From 2015 to 2022 he worked at the
Electric Power Systems Research Department at Sandia National
Laboratories in Albuquerque, NM, as a Senior and then Principal
Member of Technical Staff. During his work at Sandia, he served as a
key technical contributor and a PI/Co-PI of multiple projects in the
power systems integration area. Dr. Wilches-Bernal's research
interests include power system stability and control, renewable
energy and smart grid technologies, and signal processing, control
techniques and machine learning applied to power systems. He was a
key contributor to the team that received an R&D 100 Award in 2017
for developing a control system for active damping of inter-area
oscillations.

**Denis Osipov**, **Ph.D.**, received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in
electrical engineering from the Donetsk National Technical
University, Donetsk, Ukraine, in 2004 and 2005, respectively. He
received his Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from University
of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA in 2018. From 2019 through 2023 he
was a research scientist at the Department of Electrical, Computer,
and Systems Engineering in Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy,
NY, USA when he lead the RPI team to win 2021 IEEE-NASPI Oscillation
Source Location Contest. Since 2023 he has been Manager Reliability
Planning at the Department of System Planning and Analysis in New
York Power Authority, Albany, NY, USA.

**Joe H. Chow**, **Ph.D.**, is Institute Professor Emeritus and
Senior Research Scientist in Electrical, Computer, and Systems
Engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. He received his
B.S. degrees in Electrical Engineering and Mathematics from the
University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, in 1974, and his M.S. and
Ph.D. degrees from the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, in
1975 and 1977. He worked in the power systems business at General
Electric Company in 1978 and joined Rensselaer in 1987. He is a Life
Fellow of the IEEE and a member of the U.S. National Academy of
Engineering. He is a past recipient of the Donald Eckman Award from
the American Automatic Control Council, the Control Systems
Technology Award from the IEEE Control Systems Society, the Charles
Concordia Power Systems Engineering Award and the Outstanding Power
Engineering Educator Award from the IEEE Power and Energy Systems
Society, and the Herman Halperin Electric Transmission and
Distribution Award from IEEE.
