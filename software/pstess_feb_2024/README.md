# PSTess February 2024

This is a snapshot release of the Power and Energy Storage Toolbox
(PSTess) version 1.1 from February 2024. It is included in this
repository to provide a means to reproduce analysis discussed in Part
III of the book (Chapters 11--15). For uses beyond the scope of the
book, such as active research projects, we suggest using the most
up-to-date version of PSTess hosted on its own GitHub
repository. Please see the
[PSTess homepage](https://github.com/sandialabs/snl-pstess) for
additional information.
