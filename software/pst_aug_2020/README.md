# PST August 2020

This is a mirror of the version of PST that is hosted on Joe Chow's
website at RPI. Graham's version of PST hosted in the `pst_legacy`
folder has some known bugs and should only be used for replicating
the analysis presented in Parts I and II of *Power System
Oscillations*. For new work, we recommend either Dr.&nbsp;Chow's
version of PST contained here, or the Power and Energy Storage
Systems Toolbox (PSTess). The primary difference is that PSTess
includes models for representing inverter-based resources, whereas
PST does not. PSTess is also a maintained open-source software
project that can be followed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/sandialabs/snl-pstess). Please see the
[website homepage](powersystemoscillations.github.io) for additional
information about PST and PSTess.
