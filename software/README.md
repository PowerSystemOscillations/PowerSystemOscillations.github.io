## Software Versions

This folder contains three different versions of the Power System
Toolbox. Here we provide a brief description of each version and its
intended use. Please see the individual README files within the
subfolders for additional information.

PST versions:
- PST Legacy (`pst_legacy`)
  - The version of PST that Graham distributed with the first edition
    of the book. We recommend that this version be used only for
    reproducing the analysis discussed in Part I of the book
    (Chapters 1--10).
- PST Snapshot (`pst_aug_2020`)
  - A mirror of the version of PST hosted on Dr.&nbsp;Chow's RPI
    website. This version was posted on August of 2020. It includes
    some fixes for bugs that were identified with Graham's legacy
    version of PST.
- PSTess Snapshot (`pstess_feb_2024`)
  - A snapshot release of the Power and Energy Storage System Toolbox
    (PSTess) version 1.1. This version was released in February of 2024.
    PSTess is a fork of PST that enables modeling, simulation, and
    analysis of systems with inverter-based resources.
