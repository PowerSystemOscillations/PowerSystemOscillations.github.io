# PST Legacy Archive

This the version that Graham packaged with the 2010 version of the CD
that accompanied the first edition of this book. We include it here
so that interested readers may reproduce Graham's original analysis
with the same software that he used in the book's development. It has
some known bugs, so we *do not* recommend that researchers use it for
any new projects. Please see the
[website homepage](powersystemoscillations.github.io) for links to
up-to-date versions of PST and PSTess.
