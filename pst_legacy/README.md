# PST Legacy Archive

This is the version of PST that Graham packaged with the CD that
accompanied the first edition of the book. We include it here so that
interested readers may reproduce Graham's original analysis with the
same software that he used in the book's development. It has some
known bugs, so we *do not* recommend that researchers use it for any
new projects. Please see the
[website homepage](powersystemoscillations.github.io) for links to
up-to-date versions of PST and PSTess.
